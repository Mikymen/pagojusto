# PagoJusto

"PagoJusto" is just a small web application to manage all the owner's expenses for a building or property. It's being developed to do fast and easy calculations for each one of the neighbors or apartment owners. Besides, we can distribute debts based on every owner's consumption.

This is a single page application (SPA) that works on the client side, using React as the frontend library, so it doesn't need a backend server. And, for the moment the data is kept in browser local storage.
